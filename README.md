# Word Counter

In this program, it takes a string and organizes them by the frequenzy they appear on from most to least, using *ctrl+D* to run after the 
set of strings have been added

Main.java
- Scans the string the user inputs
- Creates a map to add the words
- Prints the frequnecy e

WordCount.java
- Evalutes if the string has already been accounted and increases the key value of the Map

DescendingCount.java
- Evaluates the size of the keys and organizes them using java Comparator


This code can easily be changed to read from a file or a website, alternatively it can also be used to output the top unique words in that said 
input method.
